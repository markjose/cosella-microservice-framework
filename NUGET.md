# Cosella

The Cosella Microservice Framework is intended to make the development of service based solutions using .NET easier.

The framework is currently a very new project, if you want to use it, please understand:
  - there may be limited support
  - documentation will probably be incomplete
  - code may not be as tidy or organised as expected

If you like what's here already and want to improve it, PRs are most welcome.

I'll also try and be as responsive as I can to issues raised on GitHub.

[A feature list and 'Getting Started' instructions can be found on GitHub](https://markjose.github.io/cosella-microservice-framework/)
